Q1) The front layer of the flower draws 5 petals. Every layer after that draws
    and amount of petals equal to the next number in the Fibonacci sequence.
    The flower can be generated with random colors assigned to every petal, or
    random colors assigned to every row of petals. Swap the commented petalColor
    assignment lines to try either.

Q2) Question is nearly but not quite complete. I am drawing end caps but have
    not properly rotated them. This would be done by finding the angle from
    the end line to the horizontal, then rotating the arc by that much. My
    line intersection code does not seem to properly find every single
    intersection in my shape, so there are still a few overlaps. The middle
    shape is clearly showing that there is a problem in my intersection code
    for cases of horizontal / vertical lines but I have not been able to
    discover where the issue is. Lastly, I still need to implement something
    to draw arcs over every obtuse angle. My best assumption for how to do this
    would be to find the angle of the joined lines to the horizontal, then draw
    an arc centered at the point in the shape itself with a radius equal to half
    the outline width, from one of those angles to another.

Q3) Question 3 was not finished.
