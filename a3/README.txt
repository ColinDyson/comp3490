Question 1:  Note that particles have a randomized lifespan between 3 and 10
seconds. As the particles age, their colour is animated to fade to black once
they reach the end of their lifespan. The program births particles with a chance
inversley proportional to the current population. There will always be between 8
and 12 particles on sceen.

Question 2: No input is read while the 'spacebar' sequence is running.
